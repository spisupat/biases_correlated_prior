description: "Code and compressed dataset from the Manuscript \"Correlations across
  timing cues in natural vocalizations predict biases in judging synthetic sound burst
  durations.\"\n\nAbstract: \nIt is well known that animals rely on multiple sources
  of information in order to successfully identify sounds in natural environments,
  to make decisions that are optimal for their survival. For example, rats use duration
  and pitch cues to respond appropriately to prosocial and distress vocalizations
  (Saito et al. 2019). Vocalization duration cues are known to co-vary with other
  temporal cues (Khatami et al. 2018), yet little is known about whether animals rely
  upon such co-variations to successfully discriminate sounds.  In the current study,
  we find natural alarm vocalizations in rats have onset and offset slopes that are
  correlated with their duration. Accordingly, vocalizations with faster onset slopes
  are more likely to have shorter durations. Given that vocalization slopes begin
  and end within milliseconds, they could provide rapid perceptual cues for predicting
  and discriminating vocalization duration.  To examine this possibility, we train
  rodents to discriminate duration differences in sequences of synthetic vocalizations
  and examine how artificially changing the slope impacts duration judgments. We find
  animals are biased to misjudge a range of synthetic vocalizations as being shorter
  in duration when the onset and offset slopes are artificially fast. Moreover, this
  bias is reduced when rats are exposed to multiple synthetic vocalization bursts. 
  The observed perceptual bias is accurately captured by a Bayesian decision-theoretic
  model that utilizes the empirical joint distribution of duration and onset slopes
  in natural vocalizations as a prior during duration judgements of synthetic vocalizations. 
  The model also explains why this bias is reduced when more evidence is accumulated
  across multiple bursts, reducing the prior's influence  These results support the
  theory that animals are sensitive to fine-grained statistical co-variations in auditory
  timing cues and integrate this information optimally with incoming sensory evidence
  to guide their decisions."
