description: "Dataset from the Manuscript \"Correlations across timing cues in natural
  vocalizations predict biases in judging synthetic sound burst durations.\"\n\nAbstract:
  \nIt is well known that animals rely on multiple sources of information in order
  to successfully identify sounds in natural environments, to make decisions that
  are optimal for their survival. For example, rats use duration and pitch cues to
  respond appropriately to prosocial and distress vocalizations (Saito et al. 2019).
  Vocalization duration cues are known to co-vary with other temporal cues (Khatami
  et al. 2018), yet little is known about whether animals rely upon such co-variations
  to successfully discriminate sounds.  In the current study, we find natural alarm
  vocalizations in rats have onset and offset slopes that are correlated with their
  duration. Accordingly, vocalizations with faster onset slopes are more likely to
  have shorter durations. Given that vocalization slopes begin and end within milliseconds,
  they could provide rapid perceptual cues for predicting and discriminating vocalization
  duration.  To examine this possibility, we train rodents to discriminate duration
  differences in sequences of synthetic vocalizations and examine how artificially
  changing the slope impacts duration judgments. We find animals are biased to misjudge
  a range of synthetic vocalizations as being shorter in duration when the onset and
  offset slopes are artificially fast. Moreover, this bias is reduced when rats are
  exposed to multiple synthetic vocalization bursts.  The observed perceptual bias
  is accurately captured by a Bayesian decision-theoretic model that utilizes the
  empirical joint distribution of duration and onset slopes in natural vocalizations
  as a prior during duration judgements of synthetic vocalizations.  The model also
  explains why this bias is reduced when more evidence is accumulated across multiple
  bursts, reducing the prior's influence  These results support the theory that animals
  are sensitive to fine-grained statistical co-variations in auditory timing cues
  and integrate this information optimally with incoming sensory evidence to guide
  their decisions."
