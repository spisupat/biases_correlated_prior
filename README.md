The Bayesian decision-theoretic models from this paper are available in Figure5.m, 
which takes a 2-D empirical prior as input and predicts biases in 1-D judgements arising from any correlations in the prior.

This code is also available as a standalone, executable Code Ocean capsule at https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.8495056.v1
